I had to teach him and then I'ma kin 'em
I'm on 2K in the rec with a center
He got the one in the head of Beretta
Jesus protect me just like an umbrella

I get the Breath of the Wild like Zelda
Whip in the kitchen, ain't talkin' Griselda
Wake in the morning, I'm gettin' this cheddar
God on my side, he makin' me better
Forever I'm home, no matter the weather
And I duck in your door just like I was rebel

You want some racks and I want a Tesla
You in my pass, like I'm Iniesta
I had to make me a GOAT, woah
I had to run in your goal, oh
I had to get to the gold, woah
I had to get on the boat, woah
I got a shorty, I don't need no mackin'
I had to wipe 'em up just like a napkin
I got the five on me just like a Jackson
She wanna meet at my next show, be maxin'

Feel like NBA YoungBoy, I'll never go broke
Put my foot on they neck and I know they gon' choke
I handle my money, I run it up, boy

Had to cover 'em up, I ain't talkin' 'bout coat
And your girlfriend just saw me, I know that she's soaked

That boy he dirty, I know he need soap
Talkin' 'bout swagged out, but I ain't no toast
Talk 'bout hitting, but I gotta ghost
Shawty she talkin', she doin' the most
No, I can't lie, that boy doing the most
Wanna talk bread? Let's go (Yeah)
Wanna get bread? Let's go, uh

Wanna know what I know? Uh
